When I paid my crummy 75 cents or less for each, I knew the sellers said 90 days until estimated delivery. So I expected a long wait. I did not expect each of the 5 items to disappear from my History or my ""need to leave feedback list"". It's like they never existed!  I just emailed the seller in China (yes I know....) who said, ""sorry can send 5 more or can refund you."" duh.  My lesson to you is look out if the shipping estimate is 90 days or so. This means the tracking number is fake, you won't see the item.   I admit to this happening many times in my 10+ years of shopping here. But thankfully this is the 1st seller to even message me back. I have a teeny bit of hope. This time.  Be careful even if it's a small bit of money. They sold very low yes. But we still should get the item!!!",17 Views,0,0,Buying,2020-05-15

Suddenly I am having trouble accessing over 100 of them. I get an error message saying ""looks like something went wrong, please try again"". These listings have to be updated or I will lose them!!! With that many listings in the drafts folder, I can't afford to lose any of them!!!I need to speak to someone immediately to determine what the problem is. I have tried to update the listings by going to ""complete drafts"" but then I get the error message that 119 items cannot be found or accessed!!!The last update on these was April 20th.

Please help IMMEDIATELY!!!  Well, for almost a week I have been in contact with eBay and getting the standard responses of : Thank you for reaching eBay Customer Service. I understand that your urgency to have the issue in completing the draft be fox as soon as possible.  I’ll explain to you further about it. First off, we apologize for the delayed response, due to the high volume of messages we have been receiving recently and limited staffing caused by this pandemic situation, we weren't able to get back to you sooner. We appreciate your patience and understanding on this matter and rest assured that we are working on this to answer your queries as soon as we can. Your patience in waiting is well appreciated. as of the moment our technical team is doing their very best to fix the problem as soon as possible. As much as we want and we are eager to resolve it, we need more time to have it resolve. We are also trying to take some other option to find workaround that we can offer to the affected members, but as of now we don’t have yet. I hope this information is helpful. If you experience any problems or have additional questions, you can contact us by selecting Help & Contact at the top of most eBay pages. Yesterday, they wrote: you don’t have to worry because you won’t lose your listings. As long as they are not removed by you or by eBay, you won’t lose them.Anyway, I appreciate you for your patience and understanding of the whole process.I wish you and your family good health. Take care always, Thanks for choosing eBay. We value your business.Respectfully, This afternoon I am missing 100 of my listings!!!!  Which technically should not have even been removed until the 20th because they were last updated 4-20.  This has happened to me several times in the past.  I started on this a week ago with the hope they would fix it.  I wrote telling them I am livid!!!  The only saving grace is that I kept a photo of the drafts folder but that won't save me the time it will take to have to replicate all of those listings. Only once when this happened in the past were they able to recover my listings.  Ever after that they gave me the excuse that they could not.  I use the eBay system to do my listings, no other program. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  I'm under the impression writing to their corporate office is a waste of time.",14 Views,0,0,Technical-Issues,2020-05-15

Once you find the transaction, you can click on it to view the details including the seller's username, and the ebay item number so you can file a dispute and get a refund.  You have 30 days from the last estimated delivery date to file a dispute.  Unfortunately, ebay will bump you over to PayPal to actually get your money back when there is over a 60 day delivery time frame.  By filing an INR dispute the seller gets a defect on their account, when they cannot prove delivery. Sellers are only allowed a small percentage of defects before they get sanctioned or kicked off the site. They also have to refund and loose the fees paid to eBay and PayPal.

Hi @stylishbeauty, while I wouldn't be able to speak to the business decisions of another company, I can clarify that a number of USPS labels printed on eBay do include some level of insurance automatically, and a seller can always purchase more if they would like.

Hi @gwzcomps, the incentive for you to notify us of potential improvements to our catalog is so you and other sellers like you can receive the best possible visibility through both eBay search results, and third party search results. It isn't possible for us to create a catalog for every item that has been or is available on eBay, so we rely on our sellers do provide this kind of information and will make adjustments or corrections when needed. To be clear, the catalog is comprised of information provided by our sellers, so any errors you see would be related to incorrect information provided by another member of the Community. 
 
It is up to you if you would like to share what you are seeing so we can make corrections. Providing a robust catalog greatly improves search results for buyers, leading to increased sales for sellers, so we greatly appreciate any time you can spare to pass along what you are seeing.

They are taking Media Mail packages and putting them to the side, disregarding deliver by dates. Last week I had to be on the phone with USPS over 6 hrs for one package that was 15 days late at date of first USPS call (media mail is 15 days til USPS will open investigation), the cases are being given a pre-fabricated covid-19 delay response and the cases closes automatically within a few hours of opening one. That particular package did finally arrive at the buyers address over 21 days later. However now I have 4 package sitting in Denver for a week now and 2-3 sitting in Chicago for about the same. I contacted the buyers and explained there is nothing I can do and just have to be patient as USPS will not do anything except give you the covid set back response. However, I have been placing insurance on most all package now in case something never gets delivered - but this is a cost of little under $2 average that I have to pay for because Ebay doesn't provide the option for sellers to have insurance as option on listings - simply been doing it cause the USPS system is slipping in various locations - mostly their largest and most busy distribution centers. Some info for those having issues with packages being held up and sitting for days on end: First the packages are NOT lost, they are simply tossed to the side and thrown into bins where they sit till days/weeks later they decide to move them forward. If you call USPS you will be on hold a minimal of 2 hours to talk to a agent - use the call back feature they will then call you when it's your turn. If you open a case on a package know that within a few hours you will receive an email stating a general pre-fabricated  response stating covid-19 setbacks and you case is automatically closed. To move the process faster and to rule out any actual lost packages open a case does not require USPS to search for the package and find out what is going on. You MUST file a separate Missing Mail report - done through USPS website only then will USPS actually try and find your package. There will be two options when you open the missing mail case - 1. for package to be delievered to buyer 2. for package to be delivered back to sender (you) - it's your choice - I always put option 1 and the package magically starts getting hits on the tracking and delivers within a week (maynot be for all but it seems to spark USPS to do something). I have been mailing those buyers whom packages are delayed or late so they know I am keeping an eye on them and trying - but reality is nothing you or anyone can do but wait on USPS.",329 Views,7,0,Weekly-Chat-with-eBay-Staff,2020-05-13

Seller Performance Evaluations on the 20th of the month will affect discounts or fees on transactions in the following month.
Top Rated Plus discounts for Top Rated Sellers will be applied to qualifying listings the month after evaluation.
Seller Below Standards Fees or Service metrics fees will be applied to qualifying listings the month after evaluation.

Top Rated Plus badge evaluation changesFrom July, your domestic or international returns policy will be part of your Top Rated Plus badge evaluation. Discounts will be based on the country where the items are listed and the item location.For more information on all of these changes, please go to our dedicated Seller Center page.
 
**********************************
 
There appears to be some confusion over this policy change by Ebay.  Some are of the opinion that we are only being eval'd on the previous 30 day period and no longer the previous 12 months or 90 days depending on how many transactions you have in those periods.
 
Would you mind sharing what the above message does not detail that applies to this change?  I personally think this change is long overdue.

Hi @mam98031! There hasn't been an announced change to the look back period that I'm aware of, so that should remain the same 🙂

Hi @terrisattictreasures - my responses below:
 
1. Do you have any draft listings saved that are encountering the error you posted? I'm happy to report it as a potential technical issue, but the tech team will want to review it on your account. 
 
2. We ask for a higher level of information about you as a seller registering for managed payments for a few reasons. One is verification of your identity for security purposes, and another is for tax reporting as required now that we are processing payments.  Your information is kept secure, similar to financial institutions, and teammates will not have access to the sensitive information you provide.

Prefunding is a big part of it. Where is DeFazio's bill to get rid of the Bush era prefunding?  Stuck in the senate still?  Why?  I haven't seen any movement of this bill since it was passed by the House in February.  This is a bipartisan bill to enable the USPS to get onto the same business footing as other major companies and get rid of that prefunding, which definitely is the biggest factor in the USPS's debt problem.  There are myriad other problems, but this really is what takes the USPS out of solvency using their own products and services, to insolvency. As for Amazon, they get charged bulk shipping rates, which cannot by law be lower than base parcel delivery.  For the most part, the USPS simply provides last mile delivery from pre-sorted bulk shipping, including Amazon.  Thing is, right now Amazon is lumped in with other bulk shippers in the billions of revenue the USPS realises by shipping this stuff.  I'd be curious to know much they actually contribute to this revenue - I have a feeling it's not insignificant.  I don't think anything is going to go up four-fold - there's so much noise about this stuff, but I CAN see Bezos just shrugging his shoulders if it's decided that Amazon's contract will be negotiated and say ""fine, we'll just do our own last-mile logistics - we've been migrating to that anyway.""  There goes about 30% of the USPS parcel service...and the money.

Thanks @vrykalak! I'm seeing the option to add photos in the revise page for that listing. Are you getting an error message when you try to submit the revision, or do you not have the add photos option at all?

That means seller will pay 12.35% FVF on sales tax instead of only pay 2.9% when using Paypal. Here is an example for a $100 item total price include shipping, 10% sales tax ($10), 10% FVF before and 12.35% FVF after MP and total cost for buyer is $110. Compare the old and new fees as below: Old fees: $10 FVF+3.49 PP fee ( 2.9% from total+0.30）=$13.49 total feesNew fee: $13.59 FVE+0.30 MP flat fee=$13.89 total feesWill pay $0.40 more fee for ebay MP in this case. Also, for refunds and cancellations, ebay states the $0.30 per order fee will not be credited. This is unfair when cancellations often requested by buyers for their mistake. So, basically ebay just move numbers around in order to charge more money from us!

I never once recall a package not arriving, but lately I cannot tell you how many packages failed to arrive. I realize that packages do get lost or stolen in transit, but in every case the tracking number is always “not found.” So the numbers provided are clearly fake. Most recently I ordered some earrings from a Chinese seller who provided a bogus tracking number. I alerted the seller and was given an excuse about a “logistics delay,” and that they could reship the package right away, and that it would be approximately 15 more business days. I asked for a tracking # for the “new” package. I was told there was another “delay” and it would be another week. Still no package. Again I was told they would resend it along with the same “logistics” excuse. I told them to provide a THIRD tracking # for the THIRD package they supposedly sent. This time I was told that the  was “too small” and they couldn’t give me one. I ripped into them and threatened negative FB. Clearly the listing is fake and they are advertising items that they do NOT even have and don’t intend to ever send!!! So they will give buyers the run around in hopes that the window to file a dispute will expire. I noticed others made similar claims of items not being shipped in the FB. eBay removed the listing from my purchase list so I can’t leave negative FB, so they must be onto their tactics. I have reported the seller and have filed a dispute with PayPal. It’s not a lot of money here, but that’s not the point. You can’t just jack people around and take people’s money for things you don’t have. I’m also fed up with receiving items that are just cheap knockoffs and look nothing like the item pictured. This is unacceptable and I wish eBay would crack down on their bogus sellers. From now on I am selecting to purchase from North America only. More buyers should do the same.",189 Views,5,0,Buying,2020-05-14

Good point @gwzcomps - I've asked mods to be particular and move threads about payments to the Payments board for a few reasons:  A) It's a lot easier for us to calculate the volume coming through on the boards to report on it, and B) it's a lot easier to get payments teammates to engage on one board instead of sending them out 'into the wild' where they may or may not find posts that they can help with. 
 
If we can get your fee-sheet sorted I don't see a problem in keeping it on Selling, or maybe even cross posted.

Hi John - 
 
I definitely wish I had the technical know-how to get to work on this for you! Bugs like this are incredibly frustrating all around - from your experience as a seller, to a buyer's frustration at feeling misled, to a teammate's frustration at only having the ability to add your name to an open ticket and not being able to resolve it for you. 
 
Thanks for bearing with us while we wait for the resolution!

So in a previous chat it was mentioned that I can email eBay about issues with item specifics.  I genuinely was going to, but the more I list the more problems I find.  I don't understand what my incentive is to make sure you guys have the right stuff setup for your item specifics.  I also question the competence of the people who set them up. 
 
Example: Document scanners can't print and what do RAID levels have to do with networking switches? 
 
Since these don't directly cause problems with selling there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to make sure they get fixed.  At the same time the various problems with item specifics are annoying.

Hi @gwzcomps, the incentive for you to notify us of potential improvements to our catalog is so you and other sellers like you can receive the best possible visibility through both eBay search results, and third party search results. It isn't possible for us to create a catalog for every item that has been or is available on eBay, so we rely on our sellers do provide this kind of information and will make adjustments or corrections when needed. To be clear, the catalog is comprised of information provided by our sellers, so any errors you see would be related to incorrect information provided by another member of the Community. 
 
It is up to you if you would like to share what you are seeing so we can make corrections. Providing a robust catalog greatly improves search results for buyers, leading to increased sales for sellers, so we greatly appreciate any time you can spare to pass along what you are seeing.

I am not referring to the catalog.  That is one thing I will put zero effort in to fixing unless I am getting paid.  The whole catalog idea is too broken to salvage even people who sell on Amazon will admit that.  I am more concerned about the item specifics directly.  The example being with how document scanners apparently are capable of printing too?  Last I knew document scanners only scan, no printing as that would make it a printer.
 


Hi @gwzcomps, happy to clarify that item specifics are the catalog - the team that reviews the item specifics concerns you have raised is our catalog team. The catalog is created using the item specifics that our sellers have provided. The example you have given can be sent to our catalog team directly by emailing sdsupport@eBay.com.

@vrykalak it's hard to say what may be happening without an item number to look at. The 'Revise a listing' help page states that sellers can, ""Add additional photos (on an auction style listing), but not remove existing photos"" when an offer has been received or sent. If you can share an example then I can take a look. Thanks!
---
Sorry: 383527289612

Thanks @vrykalak! I'm seeing the option to add photos in the revise page for that listing. Are you getting an error message when you try to submit the revision, or do you not have the add photos option at all?
---
Yes, I can add it now...the offer has expired.But I couldn't while the offer was active.

That makes sense, thanks for the update 🙂 This should work similar to how auctions with bids function. While an offer is pending there are certain things in a listing that can't be changed. This is to ensure the listing isn't drastically changed and the buyer ends up with something very different than what they had originally placed an offer on (changes such as the price being increased, shipping cost increased, condition of the item changed, images that show a different condition than originally advertised). 
 
If you receive an offer and notice that something needs to be updated in the listing that would alter the item significantly, then you'll want to consider declining the offer and making the needed revision.

I would love to contribute to the catalog.How exactly does on accomplish that?

Hi @vrykalak, all you have to do is provide accurate information in your listings through the item specifics you submit. If you see any issues in your listings, another seller's listing, or on a product page, you can email sdsupport@eBay.com with an item number and specific details on the item specific that is currently on the site and what you recommended as a change.

In the current situation, what protections are available for sellers against late shipping?
 
I've maintained my one-day shipping schedule, but am no longer standing in line at the post office to get manual acceptance scans. Frequently the post office is not providing an acceptance scan on the day I drop off packages. For example, some items I mailed on Monday 5/11 have yet to receive an acceptance scan as of this morning. (!)
 
I think the postal service is overwhelmed, and I'm very concerned about getting ""late shipping"" dings as a result. What, if any, protections are in place, and how will they be applied?
 
Thank you.

Hi @creativecrisis, in addition to extending estimated delivery dates for most shipments, we are also taking steps to protect seller performance levels under the current circumstances. You can read more about this here: https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/Protecting-your-seller-performance-during-COVID-19/ba-p/...
 
We are committed to keeping an eye on how current events are affecting our Community and will work to provide appropriate protections.

@maxoptical Fast and Free will appear if the estimated delivery date is 4 or fewer days. Depending on the buyers location, this option does still appear on your listings. I tested this by viewing your listings and entering a Florida zip code in the Shipping and payments section. Once I changed it the Fast and Free logo did appear, as shown in the screenshot below (tested on item 133223142525). I suggest that you test our different zip code locations when viewing your listings to see what locations may show a delivery within 4 days.

Its called an ""Are you sure you want to accept this return"" prompt when you press accept return, Instead of immediately issuing the buyer a full refund with no recourse. Im not the only one they tries to navigate this trechorous and confusing menus and accidentally hit the wrong button which screws up my whole day.  Let me provide some context. So about two weeks ago, I sold an iPhone X I had lying around that was iCloud Locked. I made it very clear that it was iCloud locked  and meant to be used for its parts. While it was activation locked, I was able to bypass the activation and get into the home screen and access the setting and cameras to verify all the hardware was working and it was. In the pictures I proved that battery, faceID, etc were all working fine. But I said it in the description in all caps and it was a For Parts listing since it is iCloud locked it cannot be activated. I also noted it as SOLD AS IS and NO RETURNS.  But of course there just has to be that one dude that has to completely disregard my description. 2 weeks after It was delivered and after my funds were released. This dude opens a return request and says the most unbelievable **bleep** I heard in a while. Firstly He send me a photo of the phone I sent out. Which looked exactly how I sent out and looked like the photo. But this guy said ""why reset this iPhone? I bought iPhone which one have in menu and working condition and now you reset it and I got trash, I want turn this item back or refund $80 minimum, thanks"" I bursted out laughing because the iPhone costed him $150 and he was asking for more then half it back and to keep it.  Yes he wasn't making very much sense but anyway, I reply that I made it very clear that It was iCloud locked and that I wasn't going to give him a dime, and that it was exactly as described. So they he messages me back that he got a ""different condition phone,""  and says ""I don't care about your description because this is different condition."" Which blows my mind because my description states the condition and this guy is an enormous idiot.  His response made 0 sense. So then I tell him that I sent him the same exact phone as in the description, same exact serial number, and same exact condition as in the listing photos. I saw no new cracks, or damage at all. I tell him its not my fault he didn't read the description. Then he asks me for $50 instead of $80 or he's going to return it. He also tells me to ""stop wasting his time""  At this point I was eager for him to escalate the claim to eBay because I Just had overwhelming evidence against this buffoon and I was willing to wait the several days for eBay to review this case But of course the title! While I was navigated the amazon forest looking for the god dang button to report a person, one thing led to another and accidentally graced the Accept Return button. Just like that it was game over, GG nothing else to do but suck up the $150 dollar loss. Good bye Forever $150 all because multimillion dollar monopoly eBay cannot add an ""Are you Sure?"" prompt. it does not matter at all anymore, eBay support can't do nothing nor the CEO. Your F'ed Before, people were always on edge about buying on eBay and buying fake stuff. The real nightmare are for the sellers that have to deal with a influx of scam buyers that want to pay me 400% more to ship to Nigeria or Albania.  In conclusion... eBay sucks and PLEASE don't make these mistakes-Dont Use mobile devices to handle return requests. -Be aware of scammers-Be aware of scammers -Also be aware of scammers-Dont use eBay to sell, Use mercari , your own website , or amazon for your own good. Thank you for reading my app and fix this site, I'm not the only one with this issue",72 Views,0,0,Shipping-Returns,2020-05-15

Otherwise to cancel they'd have to go to their sold history and sift through the number of items sold to find the item and copy the item number and the  go to the Resolution Center and after several more steps it's cancelled.  A lot of sellers are set up so as soon as it's sold the shipping process begins. A third party may be involved (shipper or dropshipper) who was automatically notified and the seller is unable to cancel that.  Please don't buy until you're sure you want it because the bottom line is if you buy it you're obligated to pay and the seller is obligated to ship. If you made a mistake then if the seller accepts returns return it for a refund or if they don't then resell it.,239 Views,1,0,Buying,2020-05-15

Likely the seller sent a phony ""invoice"" that appears to be from eBay but is not, asking you to pay with gift cards to have the vehicle shipped to you for a free evaluation period. eBay has no warehouse and does not ship vehicles. eBay does not handle such transactions or provide ""vehicle protection orders"". Scammers often promise those things, though. Any phone number you may receive on such an ""invoice"" does not connect to eBay, but to the scammer. Anyone that asks you to purchase gift cards or to send card codes to them to complete a transaction is trying to take advantage of you. Anyone asking for a gift card is looking for a gift at your expense. Once anyone else knows the code, your money will be gone and you will have no recourse. See here for some info about such scams: https://pages.motors.ebay.com/buy/security/index.html https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/online-vehicle-sale-fraud The only way to purchase a vehicle on eBay is to sign in to eBay.com, find the vehicle on eBay and complete the checkout process on eBay. You may have to pay a deposit. Then you typically meet the seller to inspect the vehicle and pay the seller. If you encountered an ad on another site, contact that site to have the ad removed. eBay is not involved with any ads listed on sites other than eBay itself.",42 Views,3,0,Getting-Started,2020-05-15

Something is seriously wrong with the shipping estimates ebay is giving buyers,  they are all wrong. According the estimates buyers are getting, I would have to ship everything days before a purchase was ever made in order for buyers to receive their items on time.
 
ebay is totally ignoring our shipping policies, including our stated handling times. I previously offered 2 day handling times with standard  shipping, which collectively would be 7 business days, yet I am being given just 2 or 3 days to have items delivered.
 
I've now had to switch to 3 business day handling times, despite the fact I ship everything in 1 business day to begin with.
 
ebay is even telling buyers that their media mail purchases will arrive in 2 days, and for buyers who're located half way across the country. This is despite the fact USPS says to expect 9 business days delivery for media mail, with no guaranteed delivery dates for this service.
 
Either way, I don't want ebay trying to dictate how and when I ship things, that is my business, not ebay's. ebay shouldn't be lying to buyers and ignoring US Postal service policies either.
 
I have serious health problems, and I intentionally set my shipping policies to allow headroom to accommodate for it. ebay needs to acknowledge that.

Hi @djdaniel2015, if you have some examples of estimated delivery dates that you have identified as being inaccurate I'd love to take a look for you. Feel free to start a thread on the Technical Issues board or the Shipping & Returns board with item numbers and the zip code used for the shipment and @mention me so I can test this out and see what might be going on.

Unless there is a sweetheart deal,- PayPal will then take 2.9% + 30 cents from eBay.- eBay in turn takes 2.35% + 30 cents from the MP seller. And now for your revelation: eBay is already charging the seller another 10% in most categories.

And if the seller is not a scammer, you have just caused a headache for an innocent seller by cancelling. Typically you have to wait until the last estimated delivery date has passed to start an Item Not Received claim on eBay; if the seller is removed and eBay does not send you a message about that, and if you can no longer find the item in your Resolution Center, you can start the process on your PayPal account (if you used PayPal) or your credit card account. There are various deadlines that have to be met at each stage, and you must take care not to make more than one claim about a single transaction at a time or your claim may be dismissed. If the seller actually ships something (but not your item), you must file a Significantly Not As Described claim (and typically return the item), as a valid tracking number that shows delivery would cause you to lose an Item Not Received claim. There are other scams that involve shipping an item to another location in your zip code which can complicate matters further. Bookmark the seller's feedback page so that you can monitor that to see if the seller's account has been removed from eBay, just in case the item listing disappears.",31 Views,2,0,Buying-Selling-Basics,2020-05-14

We are a large eBay seller wit over 1300 active eBay listings and its getting extremely difficult to stay on-top of all the listings especially do to the fact that we create new listings every day and we add more quantity to the old.
 
is there any Application that would help us digest our sales data and let us know what is selling fast so we could look into maybe raising the price or whats not selling or selling slow so we could improve it?
 
also what are the best tools for pricing and customer communications and shipping.
please feel free to add any other apps that could be helpful.
 
Thank You So Much 

Hello @ecommtrade45 ,
 
Thank you for your post. I am sure there are some amazing apps out there that are not eBay owned but can get the job done with updating your listings and inventory management. We do have our own app call File Exchange that you can download all your inventory into a CSV and then upload it back into the File Exchange Center, after making the changes to the prices and quantities. This report is called File Exchange > Revise Price & Quantity. 
 
If you are interested, here is a direct link to the File Exchange Center.
 
If your looking for something different, you might want to try researching some online apps that would work best for you. I hope this helps and thanks for your post.

I figure as long as my line is green on the dashboard I'm ok... and since I fall in and out of TRS none of this really matters to me... Wish I drank... I'm betting most of the new ""updates"" would make more sense that way.  🙄This isn't a difficult policy to understand.  I think both of you have just convinced yourselves that you can't understand it therefore you don't understand it. These policies haven't changed for quite a while.  They are the same as they were last year and the year before that.  And maybe even the year before that.@cynthealee2   @bbravo65  As Specific Questions and I'll see if I can help.It was a silly comment to commiserate with a fellow boardie...  If my stats are green whoo hooo I'll get a discount on my bill... if my stats aren't I got bigger issues to figure out.  (I was just confused on the new vocab about ""seller metrics"" cause I couldn't find that verbiage on my Dashboard) *****************************************************************************************************************Rant / Vent starts here: The last time I posted on the boards (before March of this year) was July of 2018... At the time I was dealing with Photobucket being stupid... I hadn't paid more than passing attention to an update since the fall update before that. Last time I paid attention to TRS (and TRS+) it was simply a matter of sell X amount in a year, and the defects had (I think) just swapped over to cancels/ escalated cases only were being counted.   I hadn't been TRS for a least a year or more before that cause of ""tracking uploaded on time and validated"".  Probably the last time I paid REAL close attention to the twice yearly updates as well... Don't get me wrong I read through em... sorta... figured out if they were going to apply to me in any meaningful way, and went on with what I had going on around me at the time.  (I remember thinking when MP came out, if they pull me into this I'll quit selling cause I could see the fees would price me out) Now since I don't see me selling here past getting shoved into MP, I'm not really going to pay to much attention to TRS / TRS+ this trip though TRS. (bracelet sales take off and I'm right back out of TRS) Really the MOST I ever got out of TRS+ in a month was under $15.00 (though if Bro's cards keep selling like they are I may break 20.00 in June) and every listing I have ever had always qualified for TRS+ if I was TRS.  I figured out the other day that they all had to have free returns... fine w/e I switched em all on eBay and went over to Auctiva so I could make all those over there say the same thing...  When Defects FIRST came out I was alllllllll over eBay policy, what it meant, what it meant to ME and FOR me.  I spent 6 months or better living on the boards helping people to the point eBay flew me and a bunch of others out to Cali to talk about where they were taking the boards.  (to this DAY I still don't know how or why I made it on that list) All to have it rewritten, policies changed (without notice for the most part), and new polices enforced (again with out it being posted) the catalog shoved down my throat over toys that last saw the shelves 10 years or more before.  I tried again to help both eBay and the boardies this time with the catalog... to be told I was wrong (with pic evidence), that it didn't matter, that changes had been made to find out months later I had again been lied to. I'm tired Mam... just tired of trying to stay on top of things for a HOBBY that was supposed to be fun.  Tired of learning something (usually the hard way) only to be told 6 months to a year later that everything I just learned was no longer going to apply. And or that it wasn't that important to begin with.  Tired of putting my whole effort into something to only have the rug yanked out from underneath me  months or a year later. Maybe if I'm still here in Jan (cause I didn't get yanked into MP), I'll pay more attention to the Seller Updates and TRS. Till then every now and then I'll pass an imaginary drink to commiserate with a fellow boardie... speaking of.... want one?

I miss so much stuff when I do that LOL.The Service Metrics has NEVER been on the Seller Dashboard.  The Seller Dashboard is completely separate and different. The Seller Dashboard are the areas in which Ebay evals you every 20th of the month for the period ending the previous month.  It is what will determine your selling status.  Defects on your Seller Dashboard are things to avoid.  Defects ONLY happen in the areas seen on your Seller Dashboard. The Service Metrics can be seen in the Seller Hub under the Performance Tab, list item on the drop down menu.  This will only come into play if you have 10+ INADS in the past 12 months or 90 days.  This is explained in more detail in the link I gave you above.Yep... read it... says INAD/INR... returns are on my Seller Dashboard.  says ""Neat. You didn't have any returns."" Last INR I got was a bracelet... never even made case status.... buyer emails goes I didn't get my bracelet.  I ask the standard ""you know it comes in a little white envelope, could some one else picked it up with the bills?"" buyer writes back ""nope not there""... I send a second one they write back 2 days later ""Second one must have booted the first out of the system cause both arrived today how can I pay for the first one"".  That was 2 years ago. On the Seller Metrics page (which I finally found) it lists INAD's.... I got zip same as the dashboard.  I ASSUME they aged off... Cause I could have sworn I had one back before I showed back up on the boards where the PO bent the daylights out of the card.  Nope I checked buyer just emailed me a pic of the bent card I just refunded... never even made it on eBay's radar.

There is no doubt that eBay does make a lot of dumb, sloppy changes. But eBay is not operating in a vacuum, and eBay's changes are not the only changes going on. Some of eBay's changes are a driven by (or the result of) other things changing, such as browser standards, or security practices. And even when eBay changes nothing, an update to a browser or even a common add-on can cause all sorts of issues. Not long ago a problem that prevented many users from searching for ended listings turned out to be the result of a minor change in a common ad blocker subscription list. I think a lot of users just sort of assume that because they did not explicitly change anything that the software they use is the same as it was yesterday; often that is not the case. And other folks are still using Internet Explorer 11 and wondering why many of their favorite web sites no longer work the way they used to.",8 Views,0,0,Technical-Issues,2020-05-15

This fee is calculated as 1.65% of the total amount of the sale and is automatically deducted from your sales. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country of residence for your International fee information. Seller currency conversion chargeIf your registered address is in the US, when a buyer purchases your item in a currency other than your payout currency, eBay will convert the funds to your payout currency using a ""transaction exchange rate"" we set for the currency exchange. The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion charge of 3% applied on a base exchange rate. The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior business day; or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s). The currency conversion charge will be automatically deducted from your sales.  If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country of residence for your Seller currency conversion charge information.",248 Views,2,0,Payments,2020-05-15

This fee is calculated as 1.65% of the total amount of the sale and is automatically deducted from your sales. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country of residence for your International fee information. Seller currency conversion chargeIf your registered address is in the US, when a buyer purchases your item in a currency other than your payout currency, eBay will convert the funds to your payout currency using a ""transaction exchange rate"" we set for the currency exchange. The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion charge of 3% applied on a base exchange rate. The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior business day; or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s). The currency conversion charge will be automatically deducted from your sales.  If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country of residence for your Seller currency conversion charge information.One way to better understand how this will work is to ask the question when a seller is paying 4.65% what will the buyer be paying % percentage wise; on their end?  Is it 2.5%?Is it 0%? This is an important key component to the buyer/seller symbiotic relationship.",226 Views,0,0,Payments,2020-05-15

I'm unclear of some things.,1,,"@gwzcomps wrote:I understand that, but do they pay with US currency? Not something I have tracked TBHThe way that it currently works right now with Pay Pal is that you the seller pay a 1.5% cross border trading fee on your end for every international transaction.  The buyer pays an additional 2.5% on PayPal's daily currency conversion spread to convert their foreign currency into US Dollars. So you the seller only ever see a transaction that was paid in US Dollars, and you incur the additional 1.5% ""cross border trading fee"" applied to the transaction. So every seller ends up paying 4.4% (2.9% + 1.5%) + $0.30 on one of these types of transactions. The way that eBay's terms of service for Managed Payments read now it appears that eBay is asking the seller to pay 1.65% for a cross border trading fee and an additional 3% currency conversion fee to now be paid for by the seller instead of the buyer. Making the total extra cost to be incurred by the seller an additional 4.65% on top of the category FVF base rate. Or maybe they are charging both the seller as well as the buyers on both ends to convert that buyers native currency into US Dollars. Who know at this point as eBay, the eBay Payments Team, and Mr. @brian_burke@ebay have been silent for the past two weeks about the particular details concerning how international transactions will be handled now through eBay's New Managed Payments. And like @mam98031 I to would like to now how EXACTLY this will work so that I can make plans accordingly between now and July 20, 2020. So far @siamjane8 has called eBay Managed Payments customer service 3 times last week and had it confirmed that eBay will be charging a 4.65% additional fee for all international transactions, but I for one would like to here that from an eBay employee here on the Payments board in writing. I am not sure that CS reps can always be trusted and relied upon to pass on factual knowledge regarding the details and nuances of how international transaction have been traditionally processed through eBay and then comparing that to how they will now be processed through Managed Payments. I can easily see were this could be lost on an eBay CS rep, even if their specialty is Managed Payments.  @siamjane8 's post regarding eBay CS's confirmation that 4.65% is what seller's can expect to be charged in the future for international transactions through Managed Payments, on a different Managed Payments tread discussion from last week.

I'm going through this as well, and when I googled this is the first thread I saw.  Lots of bad information here.  The ONLY way eBay refunds automatically is if it's a FULL REFUND.  If you order multiple items and only some have been returned/refunded, eBay does NOTHING and just keeps the taxes.
 
After e-mailing and messaging multiple times I was finally told that the request would be submitted and take 72 hours.  It's been six weeks for me and I haven't received the refund for taxes on over $1,600.  I'm not actually sure how it can be legal for eBay to not automatically and immediately refund and instead just wait to see if people notice they're not getting their money back.
 
Also to clarify.  THIS ALL WENT DIRECTLY THROUGH EBAY.  I requested the return, shipped, and got all notifications for return/refund through eBay.  They even told me at first that all my taxes were refunded (because they didn't do the math, just decided that the seller must have also refunded taxes even though they didn't collect taxes).

Hi @original_otis, any refund issued through eBay (either Full or Partial) will also trigger an automatic refund of the tax paid for that portion of the transaction; for example, if 50% of the original payment is refunded, 50% of the taxes are refunded. For refunds issued through eBay, the seller is not able to affect the amount of tax refunded as this is calculated and processed in conjunction with the refund issued. If for some reason this does not happen automatically, we can ensure this is processed manually. If the seller refunds their buyer directly through PayPal, they would need to calculate and include the appropriate tax amount themselves. While the seller does not directly collect these taxes, the taxes are processed through the transaction and their account, so any refunds directly on PayPal do require the seller to take into account the tax portion that needs to be refunded as well. After the refund is issued through the transaction in PayPal, the tax amount would be credited to them. If their calculation was incorrect and a buyer is still missing a portion of their refund, eBay could address this to ensure the buyer is fully refunded.

Hi Trinton,
 
It appears to me that it all went through eBay since I received all notifications of return and refund through eBay but I definitely did not receive a refund for the taxes.  No matter what though, I have sent messages to eBay and was told that I'd see the refund payment within 72 hours but I have not.  I have $1,600+ in returns that I have not received a tax refund for.  I'm not sure what the process is for getting me the money back, but I shouldn't have to be so hands on with it.  eBay and Paypal are connected.  When I'm refunded eBay says ""You got your refund"" why aren't they also saying ""And here is the refund for taxes that we took""?  At this point, I'm past all of that and have sent a message showing EVERY item that was refunded, what the purchase/refund total was, and what I'm owed in total for the taxes and I haven't gotten a resolution.  So what else am I supposed to do?  eBay has this money, and it should be sent to me.

Hi @original_otis, while most refunds (including the tax paid) process without an issue, sometimes eBay has to be notified of an issue so we can step in. There are a number of reasons why this may occur, and though we've worked to minimize these situations, it is an unfortunate side effect of payments being processed by a third party. While we partner with PayPal, we are not able to directly control the payment and refund process. Many of these issues should be resolved as we move more and more sellers into the managed payments program, and in the meantime we can manually address any issues that come up.I know you've contacted us already so can recommend that you either follow up to one of the previous emails you received or contact us using the options found at the bottom of the related help page (here).

Hi @original_otis, it sounds like the credits you are requesting may have been for transactions more than 90 days old - we aren't able to review the details of a purchase that occurred more than 90 days ago, so have to refer those situations to local tax authorities for credits. It looks like Customer Service has provided this suggestion as a direct line to someone who can help you get the refund you are looking for, so I would encourage you to look into this as your next best course of action.

Priority mail comes with free insurance. I believe it is a free $200 for priority international and you can file as soon as 7 days after shipment. Now that it shows delivered, you won't be able to file a claim.  And it is not that eBay doesn't care, it's just not eBay's responsibility to refund you. I understand this scenario is frustrating, but lost/delayed packages are legally the responsibility of the seller. It is out of the seller's control most of the time, but it is still the seller's responsibility. Shipping insurance protects sellers from loss or damage. If you want to protect yourself in the future, shipping insurance is the way to go. You have to put yourself in the buyer's shoes - 80+ days is an extremely long time to wait for a package. I don't think the buyer should keep it for free without talking to you, but I personally (as a seller) wouldn't expect a buyer to re-pay (at least not full price) for such a long delivery time.  If I were you, I would start insuring all of my packages (US and international, no matter the class) through a third party shipping insurance.

I understand that you are simply repeating the Ebay announcement but that has been proven to be specifically misleading. By charging the FVF on the sales tax- nearly ALL transactions will result in a fee INCREASE under managed payments.  You admitted to this on the Payments discussion board so for you to later and knowingly continue to tell sellers on this board that the % FVF is will result in cheaper fees is misleading and could be considered lying on behalf of the company.  The cat is out of the bag and ebay needs to decide if it wants to move forward with a fee hike in a pandemic or not.  If this was for simplicity - the fee structure could have been a 5% across the board FVF. That is simple. Of course I realize that is not doable for financial reasons - just an example why Ebay should call a spade a spade  - if they want to make more profit at the direct expense of my profit....... just say it and own the decision but please do not try to fool, mislead, and trick your sole customer base.

Hi @gwzcomps - the new Final Value Fee will charge based on the total amount of the sale. The total amount of the sale is the entire amount the buyer pays, including any handling charges, the shipping service the buyer selects, sales tax, and any other applicable fees.

In example, my main category Music > Records is currently 9.15% + Paypal 2.9 % + 0.30 but according to the chart Managed Payments FVF on same category is 11.5% + 0.30 which is indeed an FVF increase yet it seems if this correct that they are taking paypal away and raising FVF's to pretty match what is taken out without Managed Payments and payment through Paypal - saving you...0.05%??? Since can't get straight answer (ever) from Ebay CS can anyone in managed payments currently confirm this?  Keep in mind when doing your calculations that the MP fees starting in July will be calculated using the total sale price including the item price, shipping charge and sales tax.  @mcdougle4248 9.15%+2.9% = 12.05%. The new fee will be 11.5%. That is a 0.5% savings 1/2 a point, not a 0.05% savings as you state. Most sellers registering now will see a savings. Look at your overall fees, sometimes a buyer will not pay tax (no tax state or they have a reseller license). And Top rated plus will be applied to everything (except the $0.30). I hope this clarifies.  BrianI agree with you in that sellers should look at the overall fees they are paying now and compare those to the new fee structure beginning in July.    I agree with this as well.  We do need to look at this as on overall effect.  If most of our transactions have sales tax on them then it is likely we will be paying a little more in fees.  If it is a good mixture of non taxable sales and taxable sales then we have a better chance of it running neutral or possibly a little cheaper. It is important however to keep in mind for all of us that the majority of states do have a sales tax.  I set up an Excel worksheet and I'm tracking and comparing fees on MP vs what is currently being charged on Ebay w/ PP.  I'm doing this for May and June to get at least an idea of what this Simplified Fee is really going to mean to me in the future.  So far in May it is pretty neutral but I've had quite a few non sales tax sales.  Time will tell what the facts will be for what I might be experiencing. I am however still very unclear as to the impact of the new fees on International sales.  That part is pretty muddy to me right now.   brian_burke@ebay",127 Views,2,0,Payments,2020-05-14

Years ago wholesale on vinyl was much less, but since a huge trend now the wholesale cost is usually within $5 of the retail cost. The only way I survive is by having very limited hard to find/get editions. Now records they are charging at 11.5% FVF but CD's are more (have no idea why) and books are IMO just absurd FVF rate.

I get it. If you are quarantined for 14 days, you can't get out of the house. I guess I'm one of the few ""old timers"" left on Ebay that believes in communicating with the other party about a transaction.  If Ebay left things alone... if a buyer got an item and was dissatisfied, let's work it out. If you want to return it, that's fine. In this case it was a pair of jeans that the buyer probably didn't read the listing description about too well. They opened a return the day they got them and said they were too small. No worries. I approved the return. If they contacted me up to and including the day they were supposed to upload tracking and say ""Hey, I can't get these out to you today... (for whatever reason), but can get them out next Thursday"", I would reply ""No problem, just update tracking once they are in the mail"". Ebay has taken that away from me. I have reached out to the buyer and have heard absolutely nothing. But I will wait. No big deal. The other thing is the level of customer service these Ebay reps have. Whether they are short staffed and working from home, or in their office, the reps I always seem to get are so scripted and afterwards, I wonder why I waste my time calling.  If they are working from home right now, it doesn't really matter. That should be transparent to me as the caller. For the last few years their lack of training, parroting what I say and canned responses have irritated me. As far as seller updates, they come pretty quickly. Today, I got two of them... yesterday I got one. Plus Ebay messages about watched items ending, items I looked at once ending, the ""Sorry you missed out on this item "" messages, etc. I scan these messages when I get them, but there's so much to try to remember. My feeling is that's (again) what a company's customer service is for.

I completely agree that this extended time period to ship an item after a return is initiated is ridiculous.  35 business days is 7 weeks.  Really, 7 weeks to get an item in the mail?!  I had a return (due to fit) that was opened on 3/25 with no acceptance scan, no communication or further tracking information.  I emailed a request to have it closed by customer service.  The first customer service rep replied that unfortunately they were unable to help me and it would be automatically closed after 35 business days.  Apparently if no tracking is uploaded, the buyer gets 35 days to return it/ upload tracking because eBay assumes that they are taking it to the post office to mail (not printing eBay provided postage).  Only after I pointed out it is 5/15 and already several days past the 35 days was I able to get the return closed by a second rep.  Unfortunately, he didn't simply close the return, but had to open a case and decide it in my favor.  I always feel concerned that an opened case (although found in my favor) could have a negative effect on my selling metrics, so not very happy about that result.   I would like to know why the return did not automatically close as promised?  This happens frequently that a buyer will start a return and then change their mind, but leave the abandoned return open.  It takes forever to time out and the only thing sellers can do is call or email customer service to get it closed.  A simple ""request to close"" tab should be available to sellers once the required time to ship has elapsed --better yet, automatically close the return when it has expired!",63 Views,0,0,Shipping-Returns,2020-05-15

In 13 days, I will contact Ebay for a refund"". If the tracking information does not show it has arrived in the U.S. then the seller is lying, if they have info saying that they should have sent you the tracking number saying that.  If the last estimated delivery date has passed file the item not received dispute now, if ebay wants you to wait fine do what they tell you to do.    ""The second package was shipped by a company called Buylogic - also from China. Looking at tracking, it never went through customs either leaving China or upon entering the USA. The tracking says that ""item has been received at the destination Post Office"" - that was 5 days ago"". If this was a Covid related item, the destination post office may be the USPS Customs depot and it was confiscated by Customs.  They have started doing that because of the defective and downright dangerous Covid related items being sent from China.   You will have to wait until the last estimated delivery date. to file an item not received dispute. Buylogic tracking usually has 2 parts, shipping from China, then a USPS tracking number activated when they receive a package.   ""Over the years I've made many purchases from China and other countries and have had good experience overall"". That means you've had some not so good transactions.  Chinese sellers as a group are the most problematic ones on eBay.  They regularly use tactics designed to cause buyers to lose their money and/or give up their buyer protections.  Since the pandemic out break, the number of complaints about them has increased exponentially.  They've been listing items when there was virtually no shipping to and from China.  Item location misrepresentation has become a huge problem with them.  There has been a huge increase of wrong address showing delivery tracking. Now they are listing items they know will be confiscated.     My advice, stop buying from them, and if you must check feedback profiles and click on the numbers of both neutral and negative feedback they've received to read only those comments.  Never go by feedback percentages alone.

Or they may have shipped the item to Shen Zen Buylogics main facility who does the international shipping.  They may just be trying to bamboozle you.   All you can do is wait until the last estimated delivery date then file an item not received  dispute.

Once that happens, you're done as far as Ebay is concerned, and you then have to go to Paypal - and a lot of buyers don't realize that Paypal gives you 180 days from the date of purchase to file a claim. These sellers bank on that. Protect yourself first. If the items do happen to arrive, you can always repay your seller.

In this case, you can file a return. Once filed the seller has to respond, until you are satisfied that this is corrected. If the seller doesn't respond or make an efffort to fix this, you can now ask eBay to step in. If the seller still doesn't reply, eBay will get you a full refund.

If the buyer ultimately returns the item the eBay system can't refund them more than what they originally paid. As long as you refund through the original transaction you're good to go. Then the return case will eventually time out if the buyer sends nothing back.

I could not bid because it said I was blocked. I immediately contacted the seller, stating my confusion. He was very snarky in his reply and stated that I bid on something of his and didn't pay within 48 hours. I have gone back over all of my purchases and have never bought anything, nor bid on anything from this seller."" You may not have any feedback from the seller, because you have not left feedback for any of your sellers.  Feedback is voluntary and it does not have to be left by either buyers or sellers, and some sellers will not leave feedback if they do not receive one first.  Since buyers can only receive positives, sellers look at feedback they leave to judge their reputation. Sellers on the other hand need to receive feedback to keep a high feedback percentage if they do receive a negative. At some point you must have bought from them otherwise they would not know who to block.  If you went through your purchase history it may show a transaction if you extend the time frame from [Last 60 days] to 2020 using the drop down arrow.  You can also login to your PayPal account and extend your purchase history back to January 1st. Click on some of the early ones to see the details, which includes seller usernames.  Maybe you did make a purchase from them but have forgotten about it. If you find you did buy from them. You may want to try contacting them again, apologize saying I may have had an issue at first as a new buyer, but I've straightened it out. Then ask for a second chance.  Do not expect a reply however. Many sellers who block buyers also block communication from them. So far that does not seem to be the case.

Now all of a sudden, he has two very expensive bicycles for sale."" What you are describing has all of the signs of a hi-jacked account.  If you go back to the seller's profile page and look again I'll bet you find Except for 1 or 2 purchases in the last year or 6 months no activity.Little or No selling feedback. Or if there is some it is not for items related to biking.  If you do a search of the photos, you'll probably find they have been used on other sites. The listing probably has an extended delivery time frame over 14 days as well.Because the seller hasn't sold in over a year PayPal will put a 21 day hold on the payment so even if this is a legitimate transaction, there could be problems.  ""How can I feel safe purchaing from him? Is ebay's guarantee good enough"". Yes the Guarantee is good enough.  However, if the scammer is good / devious enough,  getting the refund could take some time, and for that amount you may lose your protections for awhile.  If you haven't read the Guarantee's policy and  terms you  could make a mistake, making it harder to get a refund.  As others have said  eBay does not have escrow services.     You replied to @pburn , ""So what is eBay buyer protection good for?""  It is there to protect people who have issues.  Though there is a point where a buyer is expected to use their common sense.  You've been given some info that should help you make a decision. If a few of the Things I listed are what you are seeing, why risk your time and money.  You could miss out on a real deal.

I asked the managers what happened to the jewelry or antiques. They give the standard answer, ""we can't sell it if we don't get it"".

Guidestar lists the tax returns for all ""Non-profit"" organizations. They have to list the top salaries of their executives on their taxes and what they spend on things such as advertising, etc. It is shocking what they make.I tell the managers that I don't expect them to sell things for a quarter, but as it is there is no reason to get out of my car and walk through their oversized closet of clothing.Sorry, that is my Goodwill rant.",509 Views,7,0,Selling,2020-05-14

Sadly, due to this pandemic, all the sheds are closed off - so just imagine all of the wonderful items getting dumped every day...I remember one from when I was a kid - the most wonderful place!  We don't have anything like that here that I've seen - everything seems to get put on line or are picked up by estate brokers.  When we were kids, my brother and I were always 'at the dump' looking for stuff set aside.  However, I see items set by the side of the road so I go curb surfing with my bike and trailer - people in my area set stuff outside anyway - sometimes they clean out their house and pile it all up and people come by and pick through it - its amazing how fast that stuff disappears!  So I guess that's our 'salvage shed'! That Goodwill is in business to fund their programs, not provide inventory for resellers is pretty evident, I don't know why it keeps getting repeated.  I was actually surprised at how long it took for Goodwill to catch on and start putting their 'good stuff' online.  I've shopped at thrifts for myself all of my life (and that's been a fair few years now) and will continue to purchase items for myself and go treasure hunting.  I also buy stuff to flip along with consignments, but compete with everyone else - thrifts are expensive here, the smaller they are, the higher priced they seem to be.  If I happen to have the knowledge to find something worth a lot sitting on the rack or on a shelf, well, that's a little reward - gaining that knowledge is not easy nor quick. But I never thought flipping from thrifts to be a source of income in the long run, not looking at the etailing landscape and its evolution - it was only a matter of time before they went online, just like we did.

If a sale or revision has occurred after an item was impacted by this issue then we will not be able to revert the quantity back to it's original amount. If some of your items still do not have the correct quantity then you will need to manually revise them to the correct quantities.

Sounds like you know the difference so only you can really say, no one on here can see what the box looks like.  I myself never use the original box to ship anything. I find a larger box and place the item inside of the original box, inside of the shipping box. Plus I still add in bubble wrap, newspaper, etc. I make my boxes safe enough for the PO to play football with them, as it seems they do. Not once have I ever gotten a message of a broken item I shipped in 20 years. I don't think it's worth it to scrimp on a shipping box. I think it looks very unprofessional for a seller to do so. I would never purchase again from a seller who shipped me an item inside of a flimsy box, and it has happened to me as a buyer over the years.  So make the right decision and go find a good sturdy box. A digital piano sounds very breakable to my ears. You can do better than this, make your buyer happy and I hope you get a good amount for your piano.

That means seller will pay 12.35% FVF on sales tax instead only pay 2.9% use Paypal. This is a new why for ebay to make more money by charge our sellers more and replacing Paypal, but they won't tell us this. Here is an example for $100 item total include shipping, 10% sales tax ($10), 10% FVF before and 12.35% FVF after MP. Total cost for buyer is $110:Old fees: $10 FVF+3.49 PP fee ( 2.9% from total+0.30）=$13.49New fee: $13.59+0.30 MP flat fee=13.89Pay $0.40 more for ebay MP. So, this is just a new way for ebay to charge more money from us! This will also force sellers not to use Paypal because no one wants to pay additional 2.9% PP fee after being charged HIGH final value fee, that would be like charged fee for twice.

In my area for a week or so we only received mail delivery every other day because of how many carriers were out.  Lately my carrier is showing up at 7pm, when normally they are here a between 1-3 pm.  Some of that is do to the volume of packages they have to deliver, but she's told me the trucks from the main sorting center are arriving later each day.  The 7 items you ordered may have gotten through without delay, but that has been the exception rather than the rule lately.

Guarenteed delivery dates to the buyer, nope not playing that game either, changed all listings to 3 days or longer. From the very beginning of that ploy when buyers wanted to know where their items were, I simply explained I did not state or list any delivery dates, and that ebay took it upon themselves to do so, as I honestly cannot promise something I have no control (nor does ebay) over. When confronting the carriers about this policy they simply laugh and said well then let ebay deliver it...When international shipping was first brought about it did not take long for seller to learn some hard lessons about international sales and fraudulent claims, especially in South America, that so many seller dropped selling internationally that ebay had to come up with something which turned out to be the Global shipping system where once in ebays hands the seller basically was out of the picture if things went sideways. Ebays shipping cart to be used for buyer to get combined shipping totals, another fine mess Ollie, Buyers repeatedly tell me they have items in the cart and to give them and combined total...problem #1 is the buyers do not know that ebay does not let seller see what is in the cart!....you know kinda like going shopping at the store and heading down the check out counter but not letting the cashier see what is in your buggy!!!! and after going back and forth with the buyer about this you tell them to hit the ""request a total"" button only to have them tell me there is no button, some have blamed it on the phone app not having it...(more time wasted and not making the buyer happy either) Some I simply give up on and move onto the next issue. In the same vein international buyers and sellers are blocked (only sometimes) from combining shipping and force buyer to buy and pay for shipping on each item they want...this gets real expensive real fast for international buyers and 99% simply walk away or cancel the orders...but with no rhyme or reason some international buyer did mange to combine shipping on their own(how? musta been magic). Now in the ebay motors automotive arena you have a compatibilty chart to enter the vehicles the specif part being sold fits.....which has NOT worked properly from day one(were talking years) and you are never sure if you are going to get the circle of death...you know the ring that keeps going round and round FOREVER...another issue I gave up calling about years ago....and you want to manage the payments now..and direct access to my bank account...(a banker friend warned me long about ""direct payments"" that if they can put it in they can also take it back out...well as soon as I figure out how long it takes for ebay to pay me then I will know how long it will take before I ship that item out, you know the same way brick and mortar does it customers pay for their items before they walk out the front door with the items.  and in the end we all have heard the story line of you have to vote for it first before we can tell you whats in it....well until I see a complete terms of agreement that covers everything and laid out in term a common person can read and understand with his lawyer and accountant trying to figure out...well I am happy with the payment structure as it is, In a world where the majority of people and business' (outside this platform) use paypal I cannot see any major increase in sales from googlepay or applepay.

I can't believe I overlooked that. Usually I don't but I trusted the initial part of the description where it says 'used' as meaning everything works. What are my options because £40 is a lot of money for only 1 functional mouse. Under UK long distance selling regulations, is it not in my right to turn the item within 14 days for a refund?  Does ebay cover me in this at all? I just don't feel like it was completely clear to have the condition as used instead of not working, thats what I relied on.

What I ordered took a month to get to me. This was the post office's problems, not hers."" How much past the estimated shipping time did the item take to arrive?  How do you know it was the P.O.'s problem?  Was there tracking showing a delay in the system, or did the tracking say waiting for shipping partner or some such?  Was the item supposed to be coming from a U.S. location, and were there any indications it came from outside the country?  Was the person's English a bit stilted?   Did you look at the seller's feedback profile to see if they were an experienced seller, and where they are registered? Do they have neutral or negatives for slow delivery, or item location misrepresentation.  I think most of us have experienced shipping delays of some sort, but a month long delay is a bit much if the item was coming from a domestic seller unless there were new or had not sod in over a year.

I was so excited that I missed all the red flags in the situation. I came across two users (yes, I was naive enough to let it happen to me twice) of the usernames @ westernwireless and @ jomcc-7901. These sales happened within this month, a week apart. I’m putting this out here so that new sellers will hopefully read before they find themselves in similar situations.If this passage seems too long and you don’t want to read the entire thing here are the do’s and dont’s when you find yourself in this situation:  Don’t accept their offer until you’ve contacted them and are 100% sure they are not scamming you.Don’t give the buyer your PayPal email; they will only use it to fabricate a fake email to make it seem like they paid you when they didn’t.Don’t be afraid to call them out. As you’ll read below, one of the users threatened to bring the authorities into the situation. I, however, did not back down because I knew for a fact that this guy was trying to scam me. Do understand that it is against eBay regulations to send a scratched gift card code over text or however the buyer requestsDo forward the payment confirmation email you receive from “PayPal” to spoof@paypal.com. PayPal will then investigate the email and give you a guideline to what an authentic PayPal email will read.Do screenshot your text conversations in case you feel the need to report this user. Now, when this happened to me the first time, I was so oblivious and nervous I didn’t know what was going on. The first time, the westernwireless guy offered me $300 for the Nikon camera that I was selling. Ecstatic, I immediately accepted the offer thinking, “wow my first sale! Does it really happen this fast?” So I texted westernwireless back and forth per his request to answer some “questions about the product”. He then suddenly asked if I would be able to buy a $100 gift card to add to this item’s package for his son’s birthday. He then proceeded to tell his fake sob story and I was sympathetic enough to buy into it. I then received an email “confirming” his payment. The email, however, was a little weird. I failed to recall any other time PayPal gave me a time limit to when I had to meet the buyer’s requirements in order for the transaction to be successful. It wasn’t until 5 minutes later when westernwireless texted me asking about the email. Back then, it never occurred to me why he knew so much about the email that PayPal sent me. Ignoring this bad feeling, I continued to converse with him. What I failed to realize was that the conversation soon only focused about me getting the gift card. This conversation only housed his attempt at getting me to send the gift card, which I refused to buy at this point. I was so confused and a little nervous that I just cancelled the order. I let him know that much. Even then he was asking “why” and continued to push me to give him a gift card. With my final refusal, he never contacted me to this day. The second time this happened was today. This story starts off the same as the last one: I get a generous offer, I check it out, the buyer asks me to buy the gift card etc. The only difference with this buyer is that he, jomcc-7901,  was a little more aggressive with his attempt. However, I was more skeptical and less willing to bide by his every request. When he asked if I could buy a $300 gift card, I immediately pressed the pause button on the conversation. I took to google and searched eBay Gift Card Scam because I knew this was not a coincidence. Google took me to an eBay discussion board similar to this one and I was on it for minutes on end reading about other sellers’ experiences. I found that this happens to a lot of new sellers. I looked back to my phone and called this buyer out and revealed that I was fully aware that he was trying to scam me. He, of course, denied and then threatened to call the police on me because his money was already taken out of his account. To which I replied that I knew for a fact that this was untrue. I knew this because: 1. I never received an email that requested for my approval of the transaction, only an email that there was a transaction that happened; and 2. I read on the forum that scammers will take the paypal email that they asked you for (and that I mistakenly sent) and create a false email with a plausible PayPal sending address to make it seem like they already paid (be sure to forward the email you get for the payment to spoof@paypal.com so that PayPal can do its investigation). I also explained this to him in a polite manner. He then continued to threaten to call his lawyer and the police. I had to laugh. At this point I became so frustrated that I called the buyer. He picked up, his accent thick as he tried to get himself out of the situation. I then explained that there is a way to get his money back, which was to cancel his PayPal transaction for the pending payment. If this wasn’t a scam, he would 100% be able to do this step without a problem, but he kept insisting that the money already went through. So I called him out on his apparent lie, his acts against eBay regulations, and I told him I found out that his email was fake. I also told him that if he truly wanted to get the authorities involved I’d let him. I had all the proof I needed to see myself through. It’s been about two hours and he still has not responded. To add on a little spice, I reported this buyer on eBay. If there's any redflags that need to be added feel free to reply with them.

There is definately a scam going on here.  Either it's the buyer or someone at the post office is stealing items.  New seller = easy prey.   Now there isn't much you can do because you did everything the buyer was hoping you would: refund and let them keep the item. 
 
Always come to the boards first to get help.  There are special mail fraud reports that can be filled out.   Chances are, this buyer has done it before and if sellers don't bother to report them and keep refunding because they are scared about a negative, these buyers will keep doing it.

I ordered some items on 16th of March, at that time, no closed borders and anything. Item is in the US and I am living in Europe. I must say, seller sent it quickly, maybe the day after, what tracking number shows. Estimated delivery Mar 27, 2020 - Apr 22, 2020. Then for like month or month and half, no movements. So on I think 2nd of May, I opened a dispute, that my order haven't arrived. Only asking if the seller can check with the postal service, what is happening. I am not familiar how the system here works, don't know how much time I have to open a dispute, so that's why I did it. Got answer from the seller, that it is because of COVID everything working slowly. So in the same time tracking number shows signs of life. Mostly it is repeating, moving around the US, from one part to another and last is:2020-05-12 00:00 In Transit to Next Facility So I have no idea what to do, how long is buyer protection here on eBay?

I like doing it and my buyers seem to love it.  Sometimes my FB will show I sent a free gift, just like you wrote. I love it when they do this. It's an acknowledgement that they liked the extra. It makes me smile and guarantees they get more the next time they shop at my store. Not once, ever, ever, ever, have I had someone ask for a free anything. Nor have I ever had someone mention that they saw my FB where I gave someone a gift and not them. Not one time.... However on the flip side, if I have a first time buyer and I send a gift, I always expect some FB to be left. At a minimum I expect a thank you in a message.

I found the guitar I wanted on amazon, but ebay had the same model in a better color for the same price. so I decided to use Ebay. I had used their gift cards before, but for small amounts, both as gifts to others and as gifts to myself. I could only choose 50 or 100 amounts on the reward service. I made the offer budgeting the amount and had the offer accepted. I was really excited, but when I went to redeem the codes in , I kept entering the codes in but only 4 took . I thought I had entered the same ones in but found out it wasnt that, but a little note that I had used more gift cards... But only 4. were also talking just 350 more in cards to enter. Anyways, at no point anywhere when I chose the option on the reward portal, when i received the codes or when I made the offer, was this clear. My purchase wasnt suspicious, was in the same country, the amount was pretty low, and I wasnt trying to redeem a 1000 cards for $50K, but a guitar. I felt very humiliated and had to explain to my wife how I just went way past my budget.. Customer service on the chat line was ZERO help, but it's not their fault, but this stupid policy and that they also don't give their customer service agents any power to help a frustrated customer. And yes this super dumb policy is on their website, in the fine print, but it's idiotic. I will never get or give ebay gift cards EVER and not super crazy about them at all as a buyer .

I guess I'll cancel. No return message so far though sent this morning."" Well Japan is on the other side of the international dateline and may very high volume sellers do not have 24/7 customer service, especially now with the pandemic. I hope you realize that all you can do is Request cancelling the transaction, but the seller does not have to agree.  Since the sale date was 5 days ago, the item may already have been shipped to the international carrier.

This way was simple and I guess eliminates PayPal's dramatics. I'm wondering if PayPal might consider Paybright a competing service in some way so are being deliberately difficult and obtuse ..it DID work a couple times (used about 600.00 of 3500.00) then stopped, and people pay with credit cards through ebay (and therefore PayPal) all the time without even having a PayPal account. Hopefully Paybright's cards will be good in 2021 like you said.

Most sellers answer messages and let you know when they ship  but it is not a requirement.

Most sellers from China have many negative feedbacks. But that being said I believe the account is hijacked.  This seller usually sells the same type chinese statues and incense burners and lately neon signs. Then suddenly they have gaming chairs shipped for 12.99 and you know that has to be a scam.  And aren't go pros more like a hundred bucks?  When the price is too good to be true it is.  Scammers jack an account and list at way low prices like that, selling tons of them in a short period.  So while you are badmouthing the seller it appears the account could be hijacked.  At any  rate you should never assume a seller hasn't shipped until they tell you they haven't shipped.  Feedback should be left at the end of the transaction not 4 days after buying.  smdh",73 Views,2,0,Payments,2020-05-14

I would also draft a note that can be sent to buyers that inquire about their items to ask for their patience during this unprecedented time. I would sign up for email updates on tracking numbers. If buyers open cases, I would message eBay and ask them to place the case on hold to give additional time for packages to arrive.

Ebay offers contradicting/no support for shipping issues,0,,"I had posted earlier on needing help with an item that was stuck IN TRANSIT on tracking for almost two months from New York to the UK. Buyer filed an item not received claim (rightfully so at this point). Ebay contracted with DHL to provide the service for Ebay International Standard Delivery. DHL can neither help me with a claim or give further info as I am not the merchant account holder. So after weeks on contacting Ebay over chat/email, they granted 10 extra days of keeping the case on hold. This does not help me whatsoever as I had repeatedly requested that Ebay contact DHL or allow me to somehow get that info so I can put a package intercept/hold in place once Ebay forces me to refund.  Instead of getting help I am just told they would likely refund the buyer as their only solution. Ebay customer rep emailed me that Ebay international standard delivery is simply a label printing service. ( This isn't a simple label printing service like when you print a USPS label,  if you ask me). Then they tell me to file a claim with the courier directly which is exactly the opposite of the Seller Protection Plan advertised with Ebay.  How can I file a claim with DHL if i am not the shipper??Even I know about the $100 coverage advertised by Ebay but this wasn't offered to me. I reference all my inquiries under the same case# and customer support number.  I have hurdles left to go with trying to figure out the local courier and working with them should my item show up past customs. I have no issues doing this normally when I ship USPS or Fedex as I am responsible as the shipper but to be powerless to resolve your own issues due to using a service Ebay provided is ridiculous!",51 Views,0,0,Shipping-Returns,2020-05-14

First, I was on the phone with eBay representative, David, or approximately36 minutes and 15 seconds. TRUE. *s-i-g-h* I explained to David aboutthe 20% off and FREE postage on my eBay purchase for this item.Also, I him know that I provided FOUR attachment of photos as proofof the purchase.David kept putting me on hold on/off during the call. After all this **bleep**,he said he would call me back to find out what is going on. REALLY????Plus, I explained to him that I received two e-mail from two differenteBay Customer Service Reps -- Luis and Reychie S., in regarding to thisproblem.David called me back, as promised. His EXACT words: ""An investigationis being done about this situation. There was an outage on eBay. Thereseem to be technical problems. We're not sure what happened on youraccount. You should notify the seller about the FREE shipping.I should have FREE shipping for this item. If you don't want the item, thenrequest a refund from the seller"".I explained, repeatedly, about this problem. You shipped theitem to me today.This doesn't make any **bleep** sense. The way I see it, eBay **bleep** up,and don't want to admit it. Again, David told me to contact you about theFREE shipping. Adding to this, I asked him when did eBay had a power outage?If that were the case, eBay would've been shut down for days!!!! Yet, they'redoing an investigation about this problem stating they're NOT sure what happenedon my account????? Plus, the seller DID offer you a lower price for the interestfor the magazine.
 
In the end of the conversation, David CLEARLY stated that I would receive
an e-mail from eBay about this ""technical difficulty"" and eBay's ""power outage"".
NO e-mail as of this evening. 
 
In conclusion, I was given the run-around from David, Luis and Reychie S.",66 Views,0,0,Payments,2020-05-13

In the example, it said that if an item sells for $400, the FVF is 12.35% of $424, not $400 because $24 is sales tax (see copy/paste below). However, eBay is just collecting the sales tax for the government. I sold the item for $400. That is the final value - not $424. I don't agree but understand why they include shipping in FVF (seller still receives the money and may not use it all for shipping) but there is absolutely NO reason to include tax as part of a final value fee since not one penny of that makes its way to the seller. It goes straight to the government. Here is the example: The item sells immediately for the Buy It Now price of $400. Since you aren't charging the buyer for shipping or any other costs, $424 is the total amount of the sale (includes 6% sales tax). The final value fee is $52.66, or 12.35% of $424, plus $0.30. Your total fees for this item:Insertion fee - $0.35Buy It Now fee - $0.00Final value fee - $52.66Total fees - $53.01",261 Views,1,0,Payments,2020-05-13

No returns can be opened again and/or changed once they are closed.  You should not be engaging in back and forth with this seller either. The rules are very simple with eBay. If you did not receive what you originally ordered than you should have opened an item not as described. Again you cannot change the reason once you opened it, so if you chose anything else than you'll have to follow through with that return.  Just look at the timeline on your return case and see by what date the seller needs to refund you by. Once that date comes, you contact eBay again and they will close the case in your favor. The seller will receive a strike and you will be refunded by eBay. Just do not engage any further with this seller. Remember eBay can and will read all messages between the both of you so keep it professional and stop responding to them. It's really very simple.

Hi @drakeprogramsllc, change 3-ply to be 3-layer instead and let me know if that works!

While this problem eventually resolved itself it lead to me discovering that several of my most recent listings weren't showing up in search results or my store, but were showing up perfectly fine under my active listings in My eBay. As a test, I relisted the item with a slightly different title and this worked fine. Of course, the problem is that I lose watchers/views if I go this route on items. At first I thought it was just my newest listed items, but then I discovered it had impacted at least 16 other listings and it seems to be ones that renewed around the same time. I went through, ended them all and relisted them all and now they all work, but as I was doing this a couple of other listings renewed and sure enough -- they don't show up on my store or search results. It's as if once a listing of mine renews, it no longer shows up in my store or searches even though it's active. Is anyone else experiencing this problem?",321 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-14

I give my international buyers the option to use GSP since it started several years back, but I also offer USPS 1st Cl, Priority and Express Int'l and eBay Standard Int'l (eBay Send). In all these years, I had only 2 requests to send via GSP. I've used USPS int'l services, 90% 1st Cl, for 10 years with few incidents. I used eBay Send about 8x, one just recently to the UK.  eBay Send automatically insures all packages for up to $100. I had to make one claim, and I got the insurance refund within minutes. All they ask for proof is the buyer sends an ebay message saying they did not receive it and the tracking does not show delivered. Depending on the dimensions and weight of the package, eBay Send can be close to or cheaper than USPS 1st Cl, but as I mentioned, it gives the addition of the automatic $100 insurance.

I am not saying that they are not, but the unknown factor at this point with international transactions and no one at eBay has yet to address this is the ""transaction exchange rate"" that eBay sets for the currency exchange. So until we can see an example of what eBay's in house currency exchange rates would be today for each currency that they are going to be accepting we will not actually know what the actual costs are going to be for international transactions. These in house transaction exchange rates need to be posted somewhere on eBay and maintained on a daily basis for all to see, so that both buyers as well as sellers can both see as well as figure out what any given transaction is going to cost them. eBay along with Adyen are more than likely going to create daily in house exchange rates that favor them both by say a factor of 10% to 20%. The ""transaction exchange rate"" will more than likely end up being a huge profit center for both of them. From eBayStore selling fees for managed payments sellers starting July 20, 2020https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/selling-fees/store-fees?id=4809  International feeIf your registered address is in the US, we charge an International fee if either the buyer's registered address or the delivery address for the item is located outside of the US.

Dimensional weight is size-based, so a light package can be marked as heavier due to size.  Both of these metrics also apply on UPS. On Ground packages, you're basically renting a space on the truck.

Sunday passes and Monday rolls around and I'm getting ready to ship said item. Before I have the chance to box the item i get a message requesting a cancellation for the item. Sure, i didn't ship yet so that's fine. I submit a cancel request but forget that I moved money out from paypal the prior day (Sunday) so the refund doesn't go through (I assumed Paypal would just take the money from the linked bank account but whatever...). So I have to transfer money back into the Paypal account to complete the Refund which will take three days. Fine.I tell the customer about the situation and they say its fine. Three days pass and I refund through paypal following Ebay's instructions. The cancellation request now says something like ""Refunded, something something we'll ask the customer if they got the refund."" Ok, sure. I message the customer and tell them that i have submitted/they have been refunded. Case closed. (?)Today I get a notification from Ebay saying ""there was a problem sending a refund"" and to ""contact payment provider/buyer"" which checking ebay there is the whole refund amount missing so clearly I'm not holding the money. (I have the recipt and everything saying it was refunded) And just now contacting the buyer they said they got their refund when I originally sent it.So what gives? How would one go about resolving this Debacle for as of now ebay is going to charge me a fair fee for ""selling"" this apparently still sold product. (and im not sure if this will go against my record or something to that tune.)Ebay's help center is impossible to navigate to resolve this issue and I really appreciate that calling their number just circles back to ""HEY HEY go to our amazing online help center HEY HEY have a good day!""Thanks for any insight or help you guys n gals can provide.

PayPal says the buyer filed the case because “The buyer stated that they cancelled recurring billing.” Totally confused, I called PayPal. The agent said that the buyer stated that they cancelled their recurring payments to me. I told the agent that this payment was for a one time ebay item purchase... there is no recurring payment what so ever. The agent told me to upload a screenshot showing the purchase. I did. Days later, I lost the case. The notification email still says “The buyer stated that they previously canceled this recurring payment.” I guess they didn’t care what I showed them. Despite the fact that PayPal can literally check this info on their own that it’s not a recurring payment. For goodness sake, the PayPal payment page even has a direct link to the ebay listing. So anyway, I lost the funds as well as the extra $20 chargeback fee.

Chances are there are other victims who weren't as alert as you and lost their items and their money.  The more reports, the better.",128 Views,5,0,Shipping-Returns,2020-05-13

I have 100% rating. I have never received a complaint about any item I have sold. I sold a brand new, still in shrink wrap perfume that had been purchased from Macy’s to a buyer. The buyer then produces pictures of a 3/4 empty perfume bottle- aka, he took pictures of a near empty bottle he already had and swapped my full bottle for his empty one and claimed I sent him that. So firstly, he stole my product. He “returned” it, however, even though the usps says it was delivered, I never received it. Usps is currently investing. Not that it would make much a difference if I did because I can’t resell an empty bottle of perfume. This buyer then proceeded to bombard me with messages every 30 seconds escalating in tone and threats. He wanted to pressure me and intimidate me into refunding him before his theft was discovered. I reported him to ebay and after much back and forth, the refunded him the money anyway. So this buyer stole from me twice: 1st, my product and 2nd, the money that was owed to me for it. I am so disheartened at how ebay doesn’t remotely protect their sellers that I have pulled all of my items and am selling on other platforms. Be careful selling on ebay.

I checked and every single feedback he had ever left said the exact same thing. (I think it was something like 25 or 30)  Well that really chapped my britches.  I never replied to the feedback, I just lived with it and let it roll off.  I checked a couple months later and the buyer had been banned (NARU). I think buyers like this like to soil the sellers' feedback in hopes of worming some sort of refund or partial refund out of them in exchange for a feedback revision. They won't file cases or directly contact the seller because they don't want to get on Ebay's radar. Think about it - If the shirt had really been too small or the wrong size, why would the buyer not contact the seller, or file a return? Ignore it and carry on. Don't contact the buyer. If he contacts you, then reply appropriately depending on what is said.

Ordered on May 2nd (Saturday), shipped out via their local post office in Yale, MI on the following Monday (May 4th). It arrived at the Pittsburgh, PA Network Distribution Center on May 8th. It has been updated daily with the same ""In-transit to next facility"" since it arrived at the Pittsburgh facility. Though today (May 13) I have yet to receive an update. Coming from MI, I did not expect my package to go to PA, so that was an interesting update. I asked my local post office about it on Monday and they looked up the tracking number for me. They said  that it is in their system and on its way, though it hasn't even reached the Memphis Distribution Center. Since thats the case, they said I should expect to hopefully see it by the end of this week or sometime next week. Item shipped from East Michigan, and I am in Northwest Arkansas. I know Media Mail is the lowest priority service, but I would think I would hopefully have an update as to where it actually is now. My guess is that the hold-up is because of the Coronavirus in some way or another? I assume I may be a little impatient with this? It seems like its just taking its sweet time to get here.  Just want to get some second opinions on this.

Since you have a bid you technically have to let it run.  If you aren't worried about the potential consequences from eBay you can cancel the bids and end the listing. Things you can do to protect yourself: Only sell through the eBay system. Don't send any invoices outside of eBay.Ignore any messages about your item that don't go directly through the eBay system.!ONLY SHIP TO THE ADDRESS SUPPLIED IN THE PURCHASE!If you get a message after the item sold make sure it is from the actual buyer.Depending on your handling period I personally would wait one business day to ship if you are concerned about the buyer.  Usually if there is fraud PayPal will catch it in the first 24 hours from my experience.If they say anything about gift cards that is probably a scam.  I forget how those scams work though. https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-auctions/canceling-bid?id=4140,77 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-14

I wasn't there when he opened it but I was tracking it.  I told him to check if everything was okay when he got it and to make sure everything was there, like the apple pencil, the case and of course the ipad pro. He opened it and then gave me a call and sent some photos... Obviously it came as a shock when all it had was a pair of dirty trousers, and completely broken tablet, like with the screen missing and everything and a book, an empty case of apple pencil and some random phone case.  It was really embarrassing because everyone is already on edge about the coronavirus and getting dirty pants and other trash in the mail is really not pleasant, to put it mildly.  Immediately took photos and first messaged the seller asking about it (seller didn't bother replying for 3-4 days after that). In the meanwhile I talked to eBay customer support and they reassured me that it is not  a problem and to just create a return and send it back to the seller, which I eventually did. It was difficult for him to get a printout (for the return label) since his school was also closed and he was following social distancing norms.  I don't see what here is out of the norm? The address which the seller shipped to was there in the order. I have a verified PayPal address and card. The package was actually signed by the person it was addressed to. Where does the doubt come in? I'm even ready to share chat transcripts of me and my friend when he opened the package and sent me the photos. Anyway, I feel kind of helpless here, since eBay hasn't really asked me to furnish any proof as of now, so I'm just hoping for the best. I even have proof of the seller lying about shipping the product.

The bank us halfway through the investigation and has still not contacted me for a follow up. When I tried contacting a couple times, there has been no answers at all. After doing more research and inquiries online, I think I have to give this case up, as there is a great possibility that my bank will side with paypal allowing this to happen. I'm getting tired of the running around in circles and stressing, so after I reach a response, I may or may not try to appeal. So far:Ebay has offered a refund, then rescinded it after seeing I closed the claim on paypal. It was a self-imposed detriment because I was panicking. I wish there was more of a phone-based convo I could have had with customer service-everything was extremely inconvenient with email and online chats that leave you hanging for responses at erratic times. Also, they need to stop employing bots to respond to initial disputes and have someone actually review the issues.Since I cannot reopen cases at paypal (which was not helping anyways) I'm relying on my bank, although a few advices have told me the great possibility of not being successful. So, I tried opening a claim at UPS in order to gather documentation and proof of the issue with the fake tracking number. I'm guessing the investigation will not make it in time to present it to my bank during their investigation.  I'm on the brink of letting this all go and have it be a lesson learned. It's hard to ignore the big chunk of money missing from my account however, so I might try to contact some federal consumer protection agencies if I have the fight left in me.

Buyer's remorse and family emergency is not a valid reason for a return when your policy is no returns.  eBay's 30 day policy is for buyers who accept returns or for buyers who received an item that's not as described.  However, eBay says if the buyer files a claim they want the seller to resolve it by offering a refund or providing a return label. If eBay steps in they'll get a refund.  And sometimes they let the buyer keep the item but you'll still be made to refund. And That usually happens when you let eBay step in the case.  And then you get a defect for having a case unresolved by the seller.  Your best bet is to agree to the refund and provide a return label and refund when it's received back.  From the onset when they messaged you, you  should've said sorry for your emergency, please return it for a refund.  That way they might've paid for the return shipping as they should.  Now that you're digging in and fighting it you'll have to provide a return label to be sure you get the card back before being forced to refund.  Then after you refund report the buyer for abusing your return policy.  He could lose future buyer protection.",78 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-14

This is not the first time this has happened and I want to capitalize on this while there is interest. So,  I agreed to his offer, but I am unsure how to proceed with sending him a proposal/invoice for the precise cards and amount he requested.  I have researched this and all I have found is to reply to his original message with ""reply with offer"". That sounds good except I don't even have that option. I only have the option to ""reply"".  He did specifically generate the original message sent via my listing, so the message is definitely in regard to my listing.  So I remembered seeing a ""request total from seller"" at check-out, but that's not an option either because when he tries, he gets a message that says ""You can't request a total because the seller has already offered a discount for these items"". My next idea was to edit the listing and add  the ""make offer"" so he could generate the deal he is looking for, however I don't have that option either when I try to edit my listing.

Puerto Rico is not international.  Make SURE the address the buyer entered does not list Puerto Rico as the destination COUNTRY.  It should be listed as the STATE and USA as the country.  It makes a HUGE difference since eBay allows buyers and sellers to make this basic error in the shipping address!!!2. check FedEx and USPS on eBay to see if they offer a better rate3. The time to check the shipping rates is BEFORE you sell the item.  Guessing never goes well.4. You can cancel as out of stock but you will receive a defect. More than a couple OOS defects and you will be in a deep hole, hard to get out of.

My sincere condolences goes out to all the families because of all the love ones that were lost and to the many who are under going treatment because of this virus.  In regards to the stolen bike i was hoping that nobody would be taken by this thief trying to make a fast buck. The bike will do him no good because if he attempts to ride it publicly the police will apprehend him . So the only thing he can do is strip it and use the parts. As the saying goes no good deed goes unpunished . That bike meant a lot to me because it was very useful to me in many ways. But i will move on to greater things . But let this be noted when you steal from others you seal your own fate . No good deed goes unpunished.

The battery had been dead for years (clearly stated in the description) and since I couldn't turn it on to check it's functions, I sold it as-is (also clearly listed in the description). I even emailed the buyer clearly stating that, while the watch worked fine before the battery died, I hadn't used it in years and couldn't check the functionality. The buyer purchased the item and then left me positive feedback. Then, yesterday, the buyer sent me a couple of angry (and vaguely threatening) messages about how the stopwatch function didn't work and that I must have known this before selling it. He has officially asked for a refund through Ebay. So, now I am not sure what to do. I feel badly that this function doesn't work, but it was sold as is. Also, the buyer already left me positive feedback -- can he go back and change it? I might be willing to offer a partial/full refund, but from what I've read that can open me up to getting negative feedback associated with the return (and the guy has already accused me of intentionally ripping people off, so I'm not confident the return process will go smoothly).  What are my options here? https://www.ebay.com/itm/254579828772

Remember that if you use drop shipping, you’re still responsible for the safe delivery of the item within the time frame stated in your listing and for the buyer’s overall satisfaction with their purchase.  However, listing an item on eBay and then purchasing the item from another retailer or marketplace that ships directly to your customer is not allowed on eBay. Activity that doesn’t follow eBay policy could result in a range of actions including but not limited to: administratively ending or canceling listings, hiding or demoting all listings from search results, lowering seller rating, buying or selling restrictions, loss of buyer or seller protections, and account suspension. All fees paid or payable in relation to listings or accounts on which we take any action will not be refunded or otherwise credited to your account.",289 Views,3,0,Selling,2020-05-13

The buyer paid through paypal before we met, and ebay added to the buyers charge and withheld from my payment, NY sales Tax.  and Paypal withheld their fees.  To help understand, it was roughly:  $2300 purchase price, NY state sales tax added $200, and paypal fees were about $75. When we met, we noticed there was a problem with the item that made the buyer not want to go through with the purchase.  So we agreed to cancel the sale, and I went to ebay to start a refund. But when I go to cancel the item and initiate a refund, Ebay says they are unable to process a refund, and I have to contact paypal, and they will wait 10 days for the buyer to confirm a refund.  Ok, a little werid, but so far ok. So I go to paypal, and try to refund the seller.   but ebay has already withheld all the sales tax ($200), and paypal has already withheld the fees ($75), and so I have in my paypal account ($2225) less than what the seller needs to be refunded($2500).   paypal is considering a ""full refund"" to be the amount including sales tax ($2500), which shows up in the transaction details, but was not money that ever made it into my paypal account.  Paypal then will not let me do a full refund because they say I don't have enough money in my account.   It is asking me to refund the whole amount up front from the money in my paypal account.... item+taxes+fees.... which is more money than I ever received. So I contact support of both ebay and paypal, and get two different stories: Ebay says... they are not sure why I can't process the return in ebay, normally I could.  I asked ""why?"" repeatedly but the customer support rep just kept repeating themselves and/or saying they didn't know or didn't understand.  Very helpful!  but what they did PROMISE ME, and it even says so right on the returns and refunds page, that ebay will refund the withheld sales tax directly to the buyer, and I only need to refund them the purchase price, and so they say  in paypal I should do a ""partial refund"" of whatever the actual purchase price was (remember, in paypal, it's still showing me the full amount the buyer paid including sales tax).  Then, ebay will get a notice that I ""started a refund"" in paypal, and will refund the sales tax directly to the buyer within 24 hours.  I will have to eat the paypal fees.  While this sort of sounds reasonable, having to manually fudge a partial refund in paypal didn't seem right, so I followed up.... Paypal says ( I went there 2nd) that what ebay told me is WRONG.  what the ebay returns page says is WRONG.  What I need to do is add more money to my paypal account from my bank account until I have enough to cover the total amount including taxes and fees, refund the buyer the total amount, and then Paypal will credit me back the sales taxes, and ebay will be notified the refund was completed.  I trust paypal a little bit more, since they have the actual money, and I decide to do this.  So I waited 4 days for the extra couple hundred bucks to get into my paypal account from my bank account, and then sent an automatic ""full refund"" through paypal back to the buyer. Paypal then credited the sales tax back to my paypal account instantly, and kept the $75 in fees.  Just like paypal said they would, not at all like Ebay said they would. In then took 5 more days for the money to be refunded to the buyers credit card, directly from paypal.  At this point the 10 days ebay gave me to to complete the refund have passed, and now my transaction page for this item just says ""we were not able to process your return, please contact the buyer"".  And at the same time they just sent me a bill for the selling fees for the item. So, as far as customer support goes, paypal was right and ebay was way WRONG.  Ebay's description of how returns/refunds/sales tax work was WRONG.  It wasn't just the customer service rep, the website itself says ""ebay will refund the sales tax directly to the buyer"".  but this is NOT what happened.  And I'm still in limbo with ebay thinking I owe them $200+ dollars in seller fees because they want the buyer to confirm the return with them?  But I just contacted the buyer and he says his ebay page just says ""we couldn't cancel your order because the refund couldn't be processed successfully, please contact the seller"" Which is where i'm at right now.  **bleep** ebay?! The way this is working out makes NO SENSE.  What this means, is that if I didn't have hundreds of dollars to add to my paypal account to temporarily cover the difference in fees and taxes in order to process a refund, then i would be UNABLE to refund the buyer.  Luckily, I was able to add the several hundred dollars, but the whole process added almost 2 weeks of money transfering between bank acccounts / credit cards / and paypal, and  THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE HOW THIS REFUND SYSTEM WORKS?! Why, are these two partner companies, who do a billion things like this automatically and without issue, telling me to do two different things in opposition to each other, not communicating with each other, than taking as much money from the sale as they can, and then can't handle automating a refund?  And then the process that sort of ends up working, doesn't make any sense? Somebody PLEASE help me understand what is going on here.  I appreciate any explanations!  Thank you in advance.",109 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-14

And even if it did, that will count as an out-of-stock defect, and just a handful of those can impair or even end your selling privileges. When it comes to auctions, you cannot cancel an ""order"" before the auction is over, because there is no ""order"" at that point. You can cancel bids before the auction ends, but eBay discourages that unless you have a good reason:  To try to prevent potential buyers from being disappointed, we discourage the canceling of bids unless absolutely necessary. However, you can cancel a bid when: A buyer requests you cancel their bid and you agree.You have to end the listing early because the item is no longer available for sale.You made an error in the listing.You’re concerned the bid may be from a fraudulent buyer.I doubt eBay would consider ""well, I noticed they are a new buyer"" to be a legitimate reason to be concerned about fraud, but that is just my opinion.",189 Views,1,0,Selling,2020-05-14

If you look at various sellers' feedback in accounts showing less than 100%, you will soon find more than one example of a seller who got a Neg for doing exactly that. Leaving out all the nuances that you would not like to get into, can you at least describe the specific showstopper that you're faced with?

You might never hear from him again. You might get negative feedback. You might get a dispute and be forced to pay return shipping and receive an empty box.  But IMHO you should remember one thing ... This is not your buyer's fault - it is YOUR fault for not setting the listing up correctly. I cannot believe that eBay customer support suggested that you ask the buyer for a PayPal payment outside of eBay system - that is against eBay policy and the buyer loses all his eBay Buyer Protection.  There is no way you should expect your buyer to forfeit his eBay Buyer Protection in order to work around your inability to set up a listing correctly.  IMHO you should do the right thing and cancel as the buyer requested.",77 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-13

If the buyer submits a cancellation request it will ask you to upload tracking information. This is because in eBay's mind the only reason to decline a cancellation is if you've already shipped the item. The other problem is once this request is made, eBay doesn't allow you to purchase and print labels for that transaction on eBay. So even if you wanted to deny the request and submit tracking, you'd have to purchase a label from an alternative source such as Pirate Ship.I'd just accept the cancellation. Every seller on here has to do it and does it all day long. It sucks, but it's common.  I did three today alone. It sucks and there should be cancellation fees for buyers, but this is life as an eBay seller. Basic consumer service, man.And, yes, it's awful to lose your watchers. I once lost a listing with 200+ watchers because of a situation like this. I wanted to throw up. Just be happy he didn't pay yet. If he paid and wanted to cancel you wouldn't get your PayPal fees back. Right now all you're out is your time. Cancel, relist the item and block the buyer if it makes you feel better. As a general rule, anytime a buyer cancels from me I block them from ever buying again 99% of the time and also forward their user name to my eBay reseller friends so they can do the same. Zero tolerance. Oh and if the buyer didn't pay they can't leave any feedback because the transaction never began. Even if they did and you cancelled the purchase because they requested it and for whatever reason they decided to leave you a negative that's likely an easy removal.",44 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-13

Regardless of that, maxing out the list is irrelevant to me suggesting that ebay put the ""block/exempt buyer"" link under the Actions Pulldown. General reply below not directed to above...That Actions pulldown already consists of actions that are very redundant or hardly used (i.e. ""contact buyer"" is easily done by clicking the feedback and going to ""contact""). I never even use ""mark/unmark as payment received"", I also rarely ""view order details""... despite you can easily get to there by clicking once on the ""total price"" of the item. So the function to block/exempt buyer isn't used just as often. Why doesn't it deserve a spot under the Actions like those?

I remember trinton@ebay practically banging his head on the desk trying to explain this one. If someone files a dispute on a $50 item that was never paid for, eBay/PayPal is not going to carve out $50 from any old money left lying around in the seller's account. They can only refund the original transaction, of which there was none. Now, in the case of an INR, obviously the seller has no tracking to show, because the item wasn't paid for, so no shipment occurred. The system should detect that there is no payment on record, and either drop the INR immediately or let it time out with no penalty to the seller.

Hi @myboardid, definitely want to clear up any confusion for this situation - when eBay processes a refund, we reverse the existing transaction. If there was no payment made, then there is no existing transaction for us to reverse. While a buyer can open a request to communicate with their seller, eBay cannot be asked to step in on this request because there is no payment, thus it is not eligible for the eBay Money Back Guarantee. There also would be no defect for something that was not paid for, and this would not be recorded on a seller's service metrics since there is no payment.

I contacted eBay and opened a claim, this is what eBay sent me by email:After reviewing this case, we decided to keep the original outcome. We understand that you received your item in a different condition from when you shipped it. Unfortunately, we weren't able to grant your appeal because we couldn't determine that this was caused by the buyer, or that this was something in the buyer's control.

Go and see your own postmaster if you don't think you're getting anywhere; he might be able to help. So I just checked the status of my insurance claim with USPS and it says ""Approved 5/12"" and the total to be paid appears to be a little more than what I asked (I asked for item value, it looks like they approved me for item value + original postage (not insurance). I haven't gotten an email from them yet, nor the insurance check, but at this point I am basically in the clear right?

Over-Simplified Example: I want to give $1,000 to charity this year. If I sell $10,000 items subject to 9% FVF on eBay without charity designations I get $9,100 in cash. Then, I give $1000 to charity. This leaves me with $8,100 cash. BUT if I designate 10% to charity and I sell those same $10,000 items, eBay sends the $1,000 for me, and $9,000 are subject to FVF which leaves me with $8,190... thus I have $90 more in my pocket than if I cut a check later at no detriment to my buyers or the charity. So aside from deals with charities, possible increased search, and helping a charity increase awareness (If I put the charity name on 1,000 listings then potentially 1,000 people learn about that charity for the first time - if I send a check, this doesn't happen), it makes for easy book keeping and better results for my own bank account.",25 Views,0,0,Selling,2020-05-13
